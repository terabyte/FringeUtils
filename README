Welcome to fringeutils, like coreutils only with terrifying circus imagery.

Using fringeutils?  Get libs/ in your PERLLIB and run metabin/amling/build-bin
to build your very own fringe bin.  A good sample set of directives for
build-bin:

> # default rule, dump canonical aliases under the default format
> # (fringe-AUTHOR-ALIAS) so scripts can call each other safely
> .
> 
> # For authors you know/like and just want to get all their stuff under their
> # provided canonical names
> AUTHOR:<author>,FORMAT:ALIAS
> 
> # For yourself, grab all aliases, always
> AUTHOR:<you>,FORMAT:ALIAS,TYPE:*

Contributing?  Dump your stuff in libs/FringeUtils/<Author>/ and
metabin/<author>/.  Write metabin/<author>/.build-bin.db.  Call back and forth
only with names like fringe-<author>-<script> so it will work for others.
